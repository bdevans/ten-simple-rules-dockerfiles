\section*{Abstract}
Computational science has been greatly improved by containers, which can
package software and data dependencies. In a scholarly context, the main
drivers for using these containers are transparency and support of
reproducibility; in turn, a workflow's reproducibility can be greatly
affected by the choices that are made with respect to building
containers. Because the build for the container image is often created
based on the instructions in the \texttt{Dockerfile} format, here we
present rules to help researchers write understandable
\texttt{Dockerfile}s for typical data science workflows. By following
the rules in this article, researchers can create containers suitable
for sharing with fellow scientists, for including in scholarly
communication such as education or scientific papers, and for effective
and sustainable personal workflows.

\section*{Author summary}
Computers and algorithms are ubiquitous in research. Therefore, defining
the computing environment, i.e., the body of all software used directly
or indirectly by a researcher, is important, because it allows other
researchers to recreate the environment to understand, inspect, and
reproduce an analysis. A helpful abstraction for capturing the computing
environment is a \emph{container}, whereby a container is created from a
set of instructions in a recipe. For the most common containerisation
software, Docker, this recipe is called a Dockerfile. We think that in a
scientific context, researchers should follow specific practices for
writing a Dockerfile, and these practices might be somewhat different
from the practices of generic software developers, in that researchers
should focus on transparency and understandability over performance
considerations. The rules presented here are intended to help
researchers, especially newcomers to containerisation, leverage
containers for open and effective scholarly communication and
collaboration while avoiding the pitfalls that are especially irksome in
a research lifecycle. The recommendations cover a deliberate approach to
starting one's first Dockerfile, formatting and style, documentation,
and habits for using containers.

\section*{Introduction}\label{introduction}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction}

Computing infrastructure has advanced to the point where not only can we
share data underlying research articles, but we can also share the code
that processes these data. This sharing of code files is enabled by
collaboration platforms such as \href{https://github.com}{GitHub} or
\href{https://gitlab.com}{GitLab} and has become quite common. The
sharing of the computing environment, on the other hand, is enabled by
containerisation, which allows for documenting and sharing entire
workflows in a comprehensive way. Importantly, this sharing of
computational assets is paramount for increasing the reproducibility of
computational research. While ``papers'' based on the traditional
journal article format can share extensive details about the research,
computational research is often far too complicated to be effectively
disseminated in this format {[}1{]}. In this field and whenever software
is used to analyse or visualise data, containerisation is needed because
a papers's actual contribution to knowledge includes the full computing
environment that produced a result {[}2{]}.

Containerisation helps provide instructions for packaging the building
blocks of computer-based research (i.e., code, data, documentation, and
the computing environment). Specifically, containers are built from
plain text files that represent a human- \emph{and} machine-readable
recipe for creating the computing environment and interacting with data.
By providing this recipe, authors of scientific articles greatly improve
their work's level of documentation, transparency, and reusability,
which is an important part of common practices for scientific computing
{[}3,4{]}; an overall goal of these practices is to ensure that both the
author and others are able to reproduce and extend an analysis workflow.
The containers built from these recipes are portable encapsulated
snapshots of a specific computing environment, which are both more
lightweight and transparent than virtual machines. Such containers have
been demonstrated for capturing scientific notebooks {[}5{]} and
reproducible workflows {[}6{]}.

While several tutorials exist on how to use containers for reproducible
research {[}7--11{]} and Guening et~al. {[}12{]} give very helpful
recommendations for packaging reusable software in a container, there is
no detailed \emph{manual for how to write the actual instructions to
create the containers for computational research} besides generic best
practices {[}13,14{]}. Here we introduce these instructions for the
popular \texttt{Dockerfile} format in the context of data science
workflows.

\hypertarget{prerequisites-scope}{%
\section{Prerequisites \& scope}\label{prerequisites-scope}}

To start with, we assume you have a scripted scientific workflow,
i.e.~you can, at least at a certain point in time, execute the full
process with a fixed set of commands, for example
\texttt{make\ prepare\_data} followed by \texttt{Rscript\ analysis.R},
or only \texttt{python3\ my-workflow.py}. Since containers that you
eventually share with others can only run open source software, tools
like Mathematica and Matlab are out of scope for this example. A
workflow that does not support scripted execution is also out of scope
for reproducible research, as it does not fit well with
containerization. Furthermore, workflows interacting with many petabytes
of data and executed in high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructures
are out of scope. Using such HPC job managers or cloud infrastructures
would require a collection of ``Ten Simple Rules'' articles in their own
right. For the HPC use case, we encourage the reader to look at
Singularity {[}15{]}. For this article, we focus on workflows that
typically run on single machine, e.g., a researchers laptop computer or
a virtual server. The reader might scope the data requirement to less
than a terabyte, and compute requirement to a machine with 16 cores
running over the weekend.

Although it is outside the scope of this article, we point readers to
\texttt{docker-compose} {[}16{]} in the case where one might need
container orchestration for multiple applications, e.g., web servers,
databases, and worker containers. A \texttt{docker-compose.yml}
configuration file allows for defining volumes, environment variables,
and exposed ports and helps users stick to \emph{one purpose per
container}, which often means one process running in the container, and
to combine existing stable building blocks instead of bespoke massive
containers for specific purposes.

Because \emph{``the number of unique research environments approximates
the number of researchers''} {[}17{]}, sticking to conventions helps
every researcher to understand, modify, and eventually write container
recipes suitable for their needs. Even if they are not sure how the
underlying technology actually works, researchers should leverage
containerisation following good practices. The practices that are to be
discussed in this article are strongly related to software engineering
in general and research software engineering in particular, which is
concerned with quality, training, and recognition of software in science
{[}18{]}. We encourage you to reach out to your local or national
community of research software engineers (see
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_software_engineering}{list
of organisations}) if you have questions on software development in
research that go beyond the rules of this work.

While many different container technologies exist, this article focuses
on Docker {[}19{]}. Docker is a highly suitable tool for reproducible
research (e.g., {[}20{]}), and our observations indicate it is the most
widely used container technology in academic data science. The goal of
this article is to guide you as you write a \texttt{Dockerfile}, which
is a file format for creating container images. The rules will help you
ensure that the \texttt{Dockerfile} allows for interactive development
as well as for reaching the higher goals of reproducibility and
preservation of knowledge. Such practices are generally not part of
generic containerisation tutorials and are rarely found in
\texttt{Dockerfile}s published as part of software projects, which are
often used as templates by novices. The differences between a helpful,
stable \texttt{Dockerfile} and one that is misleading, prone to failure,
and full of potential obstacles are not obvious, especially for
researchers who do not have extensive software development experience or
formal training. Yet, by committing to this article's rules, one can
ensure that their workflows are reproducible and reusable, that
computing environments are understandable by others, and that
researchers have the opportunity to collaborate effectively. Applying
these rules should not be triggered by the publication of a finished
project but should instead be weaved into day-to-day habits
(cf.~thoughts on openness as an afterthought by {[}21{]} and on
computational reproducibility by {[}2{]}).

\hypertarget{docker-dockerfiles}{%
\section{Docker \& Dockerfiles}\label{docker-dockerfiles}}

Docker {[}19{]} is a container technology that has been widely adopted
and is supported on many platforms, and it has become highly useful for
research. Containers are distinct from virtual machines (VM) or
hypervisors, as they do not emulate hardware or operating system kernels
and, thus, do not require the same system resources. Several solutions
for facilitating reproducible research are built on top of containers
{[}17,22--25{]}, but these solutions intentionally hide most of the
complexity from the researcher.

To create Docker containers for specific workflows, we write text files
that follow a particular format called \texttt{Dockerfile} {[}26{]},
whereby a \texttt{Dockerfile} is a machine- \emph{and} human-readable
recipe for building images, comparable to a \texttt{Makefile} {[}27{]}.
Here, container images include the application, e.g., the programming
language interpreter needed to run a workflow, and the system libraries
required by an application to run. Thus, a \texttt{Dockerfile} consists
of a sequence of instructions to copy files and install software. Each
instruction adds a layer to the image, which can be cached across image
builds for minimizing build and download times. The images have a main
executable exposed as an ``entrypoint'' that is started when they are
run as stateful containers, which are the running instances of Docker
images. Further, containers can be modified, stopped, restarted and
purged.

A visual analogy for building and running a container is provided in
Figure~1. Akin to compiling source code for a programming language,
creating a container also starts with a plain text file (Dockerfile),
which provides instructions for building an image. Similar to using a
compiled binary file to launch a program, the image is then run to
create a container instance. See Listing~1 for a full
\texttt{Dockerfile}, which we will refer to throughout this article.

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{container-analogy} \caption{The workflow to create Docker containers by analogy. Containers begin with a Dockerfile, a recipe for building the computational environment (analogous to source code in a compiled programming language). This is used to build an image with the `docker build` command, analogous to compiling the source code into an executable (binary) file. Finally, the image is used to launch one or more containers with the `docker run` command (analogous to running an instance of the compiled binary as a process).}\label{fig:container-analogy}
\end{figure}

While Docker was the original technology to support the
\texttt{Dockerfile} format, other container technologies with support
include
\href{https://podman.io/}{podman}/\href{https://github.com/containers/buildah}{buildah}
supported by RedHat,
\href{https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko}{kaniko},
\href{https://github.com/genuinetools/img}{img}, and
\href{https://github.com/moby/buildkit}{buildkit}. The container
software Singularity {[}15{]}, which is optimised for scientific
computing and the security needs of HPC environments, does use its own
format, called the \emph{Singularity recipe}, but it can also import and
run Docker images. The rules here are transferable to Singularity
recipes to some extent.

While some may argue against publishing reproducibly, e.g., due to a
lack of time and incentives, a reluctance to share (cf.~{[}28{]}), and
the substantial technical challenges involved in maintaining software
and documentation, it should become increasingly easier for the average
researcher to provide with their publication a \texttt{Dockerfile}, a
pre-built Docker image, or another type of container. If a researcher
can find and create containers or write a \texttt{Dockerfile} to address
their most common use cases, then, arguably, providing it would not make
for extra work after this initial setup (cf.~README of {[}29{]}). In
fact, the \texttt{Dockerfile} itself represents powerful documentation
to show from where data and code were derived, i.e., downloaded or
installed, and, consequently, where a third party might obtain the data
again.

Rule 1 could informally be described as ``Don't bother to write a
Dockerfile!''. Writing a \texttt{Dockerfile} from scratch can be
difficult, and even experts sometimes take shortcuts. Thus, a good
strategy is to first look at tools that can help generate a
\texttt{Dockerfile} for you. Such tools have likely thought about and
implemented good practices, and they may even have incorporated newer
practices when reapplied at a later point in time. Therefore, the most
important rule is to apply a multi-step process for your specific use
case.

First, you want to determine whether there is an existing container that
you can use; if so, you want to be able to use it and add the
instructions for doing so to your workflow documentation. As an example,
you might be doing some kind of interactive development. For interactive
development environments such as notebooks and development servers or
databases, you can readily find containers that come installed with all
the software that you need. You can look for information about images in
(a) the documentation of the used software, (b) the Docker image
registry \emph{Docker Hub}, \url{https://hub.docker.com/}, or (c) the
source code projects of the used software, as many developers today rely
on containers for development, testing, and teaching.

Second, if there is no suitable pre-existing container for your needs,
you might next look to well-maintained tools to help with
\texttt{Dockerfile} generation. These tools can add required software
packages to an existing image without you having to manually write a
\texttt{Dockerfile} at all. ``Well-maintained'' not only refers to the
tool's own stability and usability but also indicates that suitable base
images are used, likely from the official Docker library {[}30{]}, to
ensure that the container has the most recent security fixes for the
operating system in question. See the next section ``Tools for container
generation'' for details.

Third, if these tools do not meet your needs, you may want to write you
own \texttt{Dockerfile}. \emph{In this case, follow the remaining
rules.}

Repo2docker {[}25{]} is a tool maintained by
\href{https://jupyter.org/}{Project Jupyter} that can help to transform
a source code or data repository, e.g., GitHub, GitLab, or Zenodo, into
a container. The tool relies on common configuration files for defining
software dependencies and versions, and it supports a few more special
files; see the
\href{https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_files.html}{supported
configuration files}. As an example, we might install
\texttt{jupyter-repo2docker} and then run it against a repository with a
\texttt{requirements.txt} file, an indication of being a Python workflow
with dependencies on the \href{https://pypi.org/}{Python Package Index}
(PyPI), using the following command:

\ExtensionTok{jupyter-repo2docker}\NormalTok{ https://github.com/norvig/pytudes}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\normalsize

The resulting container image installs the dependencies listed in the
requirements file, and it provides an entrypoint to run a notebook
server to interact with any existing workflows in the repository. Since
repo2docker is used within \href{https://mybinder.org/}{MyBinder.org},
if you make sure your workflow is ``Binder-ready'', you and others can
also obtain an online workspace with a single click. However, one
precaution to consider is that the default command above will create a
home for the current user, meaning that the container itself would not
be ideal to share; instead, any researcher interested in interacting
with the code inside should run repo2docker themselves and create their
own container. Because repo2docker is deterministic, the environments
are the same
(see~\hyperref[{rule:pinning}]{Rule~\ztitleref{rule:pinning}} for
ensuring the same software versions).

Additional tools to assist with writing \texttt{Dockerfile}s include
\texttt{containerit} {[}31{]} and \texttt{dockta} {[}32{]}.
\texttt{containerit} automates the generation of a standalone
\texttt{Dockerfile} for workflows in R. It can provide a starting point
for users unfamiliar with writing a \texttt{Dockerfile}, or it can,
together with other R packages, provide a full image creation and
execution process without having to leave an R session. \texttt{dockta}
supports multiple programming languages and configurations files, just
as \texttt{repo2docker} does, but it attempts to create a readable
\texttt{Dockerfile} compatible with plain Docker and to improve user
experience by cleverly adjusting instructions to reduce build time. For
any tool that you use, be sure to look at documentation for usage and
configuration options, and look for options to add metadata (e.g.,
labels see~\hyperref[{rule:document}]{Rule~\ztitleref{rule:document}}).

\ztitlerefsetup{title=2} \zlabel{rule:base} \label{rule:base} \zrefused{rule:base}

A good understanding of how \emph{base images} and \emph{image tags}
work is crucial, as the image and tag that you choose has important
implications for your container. It is good practice to use \textbf{base
images} that are maintained by the Docker library, so called
\emph{``official images''} {[}33{]}, which benefit from a review for
best practices and vulnerability scanning {[}13{]}. You can identify
these images by the missing user portion of the image name, which comes
before the \texttt{/}, e.g., \texttt{r-base} or \texttt{python}.
However, these images only provide basic programming languages or very
widely used software, so you will likely use images maintained by
organisations or fellow researchers. While some organisations can be
trusted to update containers with security fixes (see list below), for
most individual accounts that provide ready-to-use images, it is likely
that these will not be updated regularly. Further, it's even possible
that an image or a \texttt{Dockerfile} could disappear, or an image
could be published with malicious intent (though we have not heard of
any such case in academia). Therefore, for security, transparency, and
reproducibility, you should only use images where you have access to the
\texttt{Dockerfile}. In case a repository goes away, we suggest that you
save a copy of the \texttt{Dockerfile} within your project (see
\hyperref[{rule:mount}]{Rule~\ztitleref{rule:mount}}).

Images have \textbf{tags} associated with them, and these tags have
specific meanings, e.g., a version indicator such as \texttt{3.7} or
\texttt{dev}, or variants like \texttt{slim} that attempt to reduce
image size. Tags are defined at the time of image build and appear in
the image name after the \texttt{:} when you use an image, e.g.,
\texttt{python:3.7}. By \emph{convention} a missing tag is assumed to be
the word \texttt{latest}, which gives you the latest updates but is also
a moving target for your computing environment that can break your
workflow. Note that a version tag means that the tagged software is
frozen, but it does not mean that the image will not change, as
backwards compatible fixes (cf.~semantic versioning, {[}34{]}), e.g.,
version \texttt{1.2.3} that fixes a security problem in version
\texttt{1.2.2} or updates to an underlying system library, would be
published to the parent tag \texttt{1.2}.

For data science workflows, you should always rely on version-specific
image tags both for base images that you use and for images that you
build yourself and then run (see usage instructions in Listing~1 for an
example of the \texttt{-\/-tag} parameter of \texttt{docker\ build}).
When keeping different versions (tags) available, it is good practice to
publish an image in an image registry. For details, we refer you to the
documentation on automated builds, see
\href{https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/}{Docker Hub Builds} or
\href{https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/container_registry/index.html\#build-and-push-images}{GitLab's
Container Registry} as well as continuous integration (CI) services such
as
\href{https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/tree/master/ci}{GitHub
actions}, or
\href{https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/circleci/docker\#commands-build}{CircleCI}
that can help you get started. Do not \texttt{docker\ push} a locally
built image, because that counteracts the considerations outlined above.
If a pre-built image is provided in a public image registry, do not
forget to direct the user to it in your documentation, e.g., in the
\texttt{README} file or in an article.

The following list is a selection of communities that produce widely
used, regularly updated images, including ready-to-use images with
preinstalled collections of software configured to work out of the box.
Do take advantage of images, especially for complex software
environments, e.g., machine learning tool stacks, or a specific
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprograms}{BLAS}
library.

First, it is good practice to think of the \texttt{Dockerfile} as a
human- \emph{and} machine-readable file. This means that you should use
indentation, new lines, and comments to make your \texttt{Dockerfile}
well documented and readable. Specifically, carefully indent commands
and their arguments to make clear what belongs together, especially when
connecting multiple commands in a \texttt{RUN} instruction with
\texttt{\&\&}. Use \texttt{\textbackslash{}} at the end of a line to
break a single command into multiple lines. This will ensure that no
single line gets too long to comfortably read. Further, use long
versions of parameters for readability (e.g., \texttt{-\/-input} instead
of \texttt{-i}). When you need to change a directory, use
\texttt{WORKDIR}, because it not only creates the directory if it does
not exist but also persists the change across multiple \texttt{RUN}
instructions.

Second, clarity is nearly always more important than brevity. For
example, if your container uses a script to run a complex install
routine, instead of removing it from the container upon completion,
which is commonly seen in production \texttt{Dockerfile}s aiming at
small image sizes (cf.~{[}12{]}), you should keep the script in the
container for a future user to inspect; the script size is negligible
compared to the image size. However, a common pattern you will encounter
is a single and very lengthy \texttt{RUN} instruction chaining multiple
commands, which installs software and cleans up afterwards. For example
(a) the instruction updates the database of available packages, installs
a piece of software from a package repository, and purges the cache of
the package manager, or (b) the instruction downloads a software's
source archive, unpacks it, builds and installs the software, and then
removes the downloaded archive and all temporary files. Although this
pattern creates instructions that are harder to read, it is very common
and can even increase clarity within the image file system because
installation and build artifacts are gone. In general, if your container
is mostly software dependencies, you should not need to worry about
image size because (a) your data is likely to have much larger storage
requirements, and (b) transparency and inspectability outweigh storage
concerns in data science. If you really need to reduce the size, you may
look into using multiple containers (cf.~{[}12{]}) or multi-stage builds
{[}37{]}.

Depending on the programming language used, your project may already
contain files to manage dependencies, and you may use a package manager
to control this aspect of the computing environment. This is a very good
practice and helpful, though you should consider the externalisation of
content to outside of the \texttt{Dockerfile} (see
\hyperref[{rule:mount}]{Rule~\ztitleref{rule:mount}}). Often, a single
long \texttt{Dockerfile} with sections and helpful comments can be more
understandable than a collection of separate files.

Generally, aim to design the \texttt{RUN} instructions so that each
performs one scoped action, e.g., download, compile, and install
\emph{one tool}. This makes the lines of your \texttt{Dockerfile} a
well-documented recipe for the user as well as a machine. Each
instruction will result in a new layer, and reasonably grouped changes
increase readability of the \texttt{Dockerfile} and facilitate
inspection of the image, e.g., with tools like dive {[}38{]}. Convoluted
\texttt{RUN} instructions can be acceptable to reduce the number of
layers, but careful layout and consistent formatting should be applied.

Although you will find \texttt{Dockerfile}s that use
\href{https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/\#set-build-time-variables---build-arg}{\emph{build-time
variables}} to dynamically change parameters at build time, such a
customisation option reduces clarity for data science workflows.

\hypertarget{explain-in-comments}{%
\subsection{Explain in comments}\label{explain-in-comments}}

As you are writing the \texttt{Dockerfile}, be mindful of how other
people (including future you!) will read it and why. Are your choices
and commands being executed clearly, or are further comments warranted?
To assist others in making sense of your \texttt{Dockerfile}, you can
add comments that include links to online forums, code repository
issues, or version control commit messages to give context for your
specific decisions. For example
\href{https://github.com/Kaggle/docker-rstats/blob/master/Dockerfile}{this
\texttt{Dockerfile} by Kaggle} does a good job of explaining the
reasoning behind the contained instructions. If you copy instructions
from another \texttt{Dockerfile}, acknowledge the source in a comment.
Also, it can be helpful to include comments about commands that did not
work so you do not repeat past mistakes. Further, if you find that you
need to remember an undocumented step, that is an indication this step
should be documented in the \texttt{Dockerfile}. All instructions can be
grouped starting with a short comment, which also makes it easier to
spot changes if your \texttt{Dockerfile} is managed in some version
control system (see
\hyperref[{rule:publish}]{Rule~\ztitleref{rule:publish}}). Listing~2
shows a selection of typical kinds of comments that are useful to
include in a \texttt{Dockerfile}.

\hypertarget{add-metadata-as-labels}{%
\subsection{Add metadata as labels}\label{add-metadata-as-labels}}

Docker automatically captures useful information in the image metadata,
such as the version of Docker used for building the image. The
\href{https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/\#label}{\texttt{LABEL}
instruction} can add \emph{custom metadata} to images. You can view all
labels and other image metadata with
\href{https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/inspect/}{\texttt{docker\ inspect}}
command. Listing~3 shows the most relevant ones for data science
workflows. Labels serve as structured metadata that can be leveraged by
services, e.g., https://microbadger.com/labels. For example, software
versions of containerised applications (cf.~{[}12{]}), licenses, and
maintainer contact information are commonly seen, and they are very
useful if a \texttt{Dockerfile} is discovered out of context. Regarding
licensing information, this should include the license of your own code
and could point to a \texttt{LICENSE} file within the image
(cf.~{[}12{]}). While you can add arbitrarily complex information with
labels, for data science scenarios the user-facing documentation is much
more important. Relevant metadata that might be more utilised with
future tools include global identifiers such as
\href{https://orcid.org/}{ORCID identifiers}, DOIs of the research
compendium (cf.~\url{https://research-compendium.science}), e.g.,
\href{https://help.zenodo.org/}{reserved on Zenodo}, or a funding
agency's grant number. You can use the
\href{https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/\#arg}{\texttt{ARG}
instruction} to pass variables at build time, for example to pass values
into labels, such as the current date or version control revision.
However, a script or \texttt{Makefile} might be required to not forget
that you set the argument (see
\hyperref[{rule:usage}]{Rule~\ztitleref{rule:usage}}).

The OCI Image Format Specification provides some common label keys (see
the ``Annotations'' section in {[}39{]}) to help standardise field names
across container tools, as shown below. Some keys hold specific content,
e.g., \texttt{org.opencontainers.image.documentation} is a URL as
character string pointing to documentation on the image, and
\texttt{org.opencontainers.image.licenses} is the
\href{https://spdx.org/licenses/}{SPDX license identifier}. You may also
commonly find labels in the deprecated
\href{http://label-schema.org/rc1/}{\texttt{org.label-schema}-specification}
format, e.g., \texttt{org.label-schema.description}. However, we
encourage the use of the OCI schema in all new and unlabelled projects.

The
\href{https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/\#env}{\texttt{ENV}
instruction} in a \texttt{Dockerfile} allows for defining environment
variables. These variables persist inside the container and can be
useful, for example, for (a) setting software versions or paths and
reusing them across multiple instructions to avoid mistakes, (b)
specifying metadata intended to be discovered by installed libraries or
software, or (c) adding binaries to the path (\texttt{PATH}) or library
path (\texttt{LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH}). You should be careful to distinguish
these environment variables from those that might vary and be required
at runtime. Listing~4 shows some examples. For runtime environment
variables, either to set a new variable or override one set in the
container, you can use the \texttt{-\/-env} parameter of
\texttt{docker\ run} (see Listings~4 and~6).

\hypertarget{include-usage-instructions}{%
\subsection{Include usage
instructions}\label{include-usage-instructions}}

It is often helpful to provide usage instructions, i.e., how to
\texttt{docker\ build} and \texttt{docker\ run} the image, \emph{within}
the \texttt{Dockerfile}, either at the top or bottom where the reader is
likely to find them. Such documentation is especially relevant if volume
mounts, specific names, or ports are important for using the container;
see, for example, the final lines of Listing~1. These instructions are
not limited to \texttt{docker\ \textless{}command\textgreater{}} but
include the usage of bespoke scripts, a \texttt{Makefile}, or
\texttt{docker-compose} (see
\hyperref[{rule:interactive}]{Rule~\ztitleref{rule:interactive}} and
\hyperref[{rule:usage}]{Rule~\ztitleref{rule:usage}}). Following a
common coding aphorism, we might say \emph{``A Dockerfile written three
months ago may just as well have been written by someone else''}. Thus,
usage instructions help others, because they quickly get them running
your workflow and interacting with the container in the intended way
without reading all of the instructions (a
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn\%27t_read}{``tl;dr''}-kind
of usage). The \texttt{Dockerfile} alongside your documentation strategy
is a demonstration of your careful work habits and good intentions for
transparency and computational reproducibility.

\hypertarget{order-instructions}{%
\section{5. Order instructions}\label{order-instructions}}

\ztitlerefsetup{title=5} \zlabel{rule:order} \label{rule:order} \zrefused{rule:order}

You will regularly build an image during development of your workflow.
You can take advantage of \emph{build caching} to avoid execution of
time-consuming instructions, e.g., install from a remote resource or a
copying a file that gets cached. Therefore, you should keep instructions
\emph{in order} of least likely to change to most likely to change.
Docker will execute the instructions in the order that they appear in
the \texttt{Dockerfile}; when one instruction is completed, the result
is cached, and the build moves to the next one. If you change something
in the Dockerfile and rebuild the container, each instruction is
inspected in turn. If it has not changed, the cached layer is used and
the build progresses. Conversely, if the line has changed, that build
step is executed afresh, and then every subsequent instruction will have
to be executed in case the changed line influences a later instruction.
You should regularly re-build the image using the \texttt{-\/-no-cache}
option to learn about broken instructions as soon as possible
(cf.~\hyperref[{rule:usage}]{Rule~\ztitleref{rule:usage}}). Such a
re-build is also a good occasion to revisit the order of instructions,
e.g., if you appended an instruction at the end to save time while
iteratively developing the \texttt{Dockerfile}, and the formatting. You
can add a version tag to the image before the re-build to make sure to
keep a working environment at hand. A recommended ordering based on
these considerations is as follows, and you can use comments to visually
separate these sections in your file (cf.~Listing~1):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  System libraries
\item
  Language-specific libraries or modules
\item
  from repositories (i.e., binaries)
\item
  from source (e.g., GitHub)
\item
  Installation of your own software and scripts (if not mounted)
\item
  Copying data and configuration (if not mounted)

\ztitlerefsetup{title=6} \zlabel{rule:pinning} \label{rule:pinning} \zrefused{rule:pinning}

The reproducibility of your \texttt{Dockerfile} heavily depends on how
well you define the versions of software to be installed in the image.
The more specifically you can define them the better, because using the
desired version leads to reproducible builds. The practice of specifying
versions of software is called \emph{version pinning} (e.g., on
\texttt{apt}: https://blog.backslasher.net/my-pinning-guidelines.html).
For stable workflows in a scientific context, it is generally advised to
freeze the computing environment explicitly and not rely on the
``current'' or ``latest'' software, which is a moving target.

\hypertarget{system-libraries}{%
\subsection{System libraries}\label{system-libraries}}

System library versions can largely come from the base image tag that
you choose to use, e.g., \texttt{ubuntu:18.04}, because the operating
system's software repositories are very unlikely to introduce breaking
changes but will predominantly fix errors with newer versions. However,
you can also install specific versions of system packages with the
respective package manager. For example, you might want to demonstrate a
bug, prevent a bug in an updated version, or pin a working version if
you suspect an update could lead to a problem. Generally, system
libraries are more stable than software modules supporting analysis
scripts, but in some cases they can be highly relevant to your workflow.
\emph{Installing from source} is a useful way to install very specific
versions, but it comes at the cost of longer build time and more complex
instructions. Here are some examples of terminal commands that will list
the currently installed versions of software on your system:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Debian/Ubuntu: \texttt{dpkg\ -\/-list}
\item
  Alpine: \texttt{apk\ -vv\ info\textbar{}sort}
\item
  CentOS: \texttt{yum\ list\ installed} or \texttt{rpm\ -qa}
\end{itemize}

When you install several system libraries, it is good practice to add
comments about why the dependencies are needed (see Listing~1). This
way, if a piece of software is removed from the container, it will be
easier to remove the system dependencies that are no longer needed,
thereby reducing maintenance overhead: You will not unnecessarily fix
problems with a library that is no longer needed or include long-running
installations.

\hypertarget{extension-packages-and-programming-language-modules}{%
\subsection{Extension packages and programming language
modules}\label{extension-packages-and-programming-language-modules}}

If you need to install packages or dependencies for a specific language,
package managers are a good option. Package managers generally provide
reliable mirrors or endpoints to download software, many packages are
tested before release, and, most importantly, they provide access to
specific versions. Most package managers have a command line interface
that can be used from \texttt{RUN} commands in your \texttt{Dockerfile},
along with various flavours of ``freeze'' commands that can output a
text file listing all software packages and versions
(cf.~\url{https://markwoodbridge.com/2017/03/05/jupyter-reproducible-science.html}
cited by {[}5{]}). The biggest risk with using package managers with
respect to a \texttt{Dockerfile} is outsourcing configuration. As an
example, here are configuration files supported by commonly used
languages in scientific programming:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist

In some cases (e.g., Conda), the package manager is also able to make
decisions about what versions to install, which is likely to lead to a
non-reproducible build. Because all of the above files require the user
to inspect the file or the build to see what is installed, we suggest
that when you only have a few packages, write the install steps and
versions directly into the \texttt{Dockerfile} (also for clarity, see
\hyperref[{rule:clarity}]{Rule~\ztitleref{rule:clarity}}). For example,
the \texttt{RUN} instruction here:

\footnotesize

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{RUN}\NormalTok{ pip install \textbackslash{}}
\NormalTok{  geopy==1.20.0 \textbackslash{}}
\NormalTok{  uszipcode==0.2.2}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\normalsize

serves as more clear documentation in a \texttt{Dockerfile} than a
\texttt{requirements.txt} file that lists the same:

\footnotesize

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{RUN}\NormalTok{ pip install -r requirements.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\normalsize

This modularisation may pose a risk for understandability and
consistency, but it can be mitigated by carefully managing all these
files in the same version-controlled project. You can also use package
managers to install software from source code \texttt{COPY}ied into the
image (see~\hyperref[{rule:mount}]{Rule~\ztitleref{rule:mount}}). And,
finally, you can use many package managers to install software obtained
from code management repositories, e.g., installing a specific tool
identified by a GitHub version tag or commit hash. Be aware of the risk
of depending on such repositories, especially if they are out of your
control, but the installation command with a full URL should allow
readers of your \texttt{Dockerfile} to dig deeper if problems arise.
Such an installation from a source gives you much freedom, including the
freedom to shoot yourself in the foot! The version pinning capabilities
of these file formats and package managers are described in their
respective documentation.

As a final note on software installation, you should be aware of the
\href{https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/\#user}{\texttt{USER}
instruction} in a \texttt{Dockerfile} and how your base image might
change the user for particular instructions, which can impact by which
user account some commands can be run within the container. It is common
to use images with the default user \texttt{root}, which is required for
installing system dependencies. We recommend making sure that the image
works without specifying any users, and, if your image deviates from
that, we suggest you document it precisely. One reason you will
encounter base images running a non-root user (popular examples are the
Jupyter and Rocker images) is to avoid permission problems when mounting
files into the container, especially for ``output'' files
(see~\hyperref[{rule:mount}]{Rule~\ztitleref{rule:mount}}).

\hypertarget{mount-user-scripts-and-data}{%
\section*{7. Mount user scripts and
data}\label{mount-user-scripts-and-data}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{7. Mount user scripts and data}

\ztitlerefsetup{title=7} \zlabel{rule:mount} \label{rule:mount} \zrefused{rule:mount}

The role of containers is to provide the computing environment, not to
encapsulate datasets or custom scripts. It is better to include data
files and custom scripts from the local machine in the container at
runtime, and use the container image primarily for the software and
dependencies. This insertion is achieved by using
\href{https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/}{\emph{bind mounts}}.
Mounting these files is preferable to using the
\texttt{ADD}/\texttt{COPY} instructions in the \texttt{Dockerfile},
because files persist when the container instance or image is removed
from your system, and the files are more accessible when the workspace
is published. If you want to add local files to the container, we prefer
\texttt{COPY} because it is explicit and you do not need \texttt{ADD}'s
extra features, which are (a) URL as a source, which can be used instead
of a \texttt{RUN\ wget} or \texttt{RUN\ curl} to download files and (b)
a local \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)}{tar file}
as a source, which you should avoid because such an archive file will be
harder for future readers of your \texttt{Dockerfile} to make sense of
and cannot be properly version controlled. Unless specific features are
needed, bind mounts are also preferable to
\href{https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/}{storage volumes}.

Standalone \emph{script files} are distinct from other software, as they
are treated as files and managed software, i.e., installed with a
package manager and versioned. If you developed extensive software for a
specific analysis, you should ideally publish it as a software package
and follow \hyperref[{rule:pinning}]{Rule~\ztitleref{rule:pinning}} for
installing it (cf. ``A package first'' in {[}12{]}). Consider using a
suitable package system with pinned versions even for small scripts if
the functions are reusable across datasets or workflows by you or
others. If you cannot publish a software project in the appropriate
language's package structure, you should make sure the source code files
you \texttt{COPY} into the image are published together with the
\texttt{Dockerfile}
(see~\hyperref[{rule:publish}]{Rule~\ztitleref{rule:publish}}). If the
code and \texttt{Dockerfile} are in the same repository, the origin and
results of the \texttt{COPY} instruction and subsequent installation
code will be understandable in the future.

Storing \emph{data files} outside of the container allows for handling
of very large datasets and datasets with data worthy of protection,
e.g., proprietary data or private information. Do not include such data
in an image. To avoid publishing sensitive data by accident, you can add
the data directory to the
\href{https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/\#use-a-dockerignore-file}{\texttt{.dockerignore}}
file, which excludes files and directories from the
\href{https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/\#extended-description}{build
context}, i.e., the set of files considered by \texttt{docker\ build}.
Ignoring data files also speeds up the build in cases where there are
very large files or many small files; for example, large data files or
the \texttt{.git} folder of the \href{https://git-scm.com/}{Git version
control system}, which contains many small files across numerous
folders, are usually not needed during image build. In any case, you
should include dummy or test data into the image to ensure that a
container is functional without the actual dataset, e.g., for automated
tests, instructions in the user manual, or peer review (see also
``functional testing logic'' in {[}12{]}). For all these cases, you
should provide clear instructions for users in the \texttt{README} on
how to obtain actual or dummy data. When publishing your workspace,
e.g., on Zenodo, having data and script contents as regular files
outside of the container makes them more accessible to others, for
example for reuse or analysis.

A mount can also be used to access \emph{output data} from a container;
this can be an extra mount or the same \texttt{data} directory.
Alternatively, you can use the
\href{https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cp/}{\texttt{docker\ cp}}
command to access files from a running or stopped container, but this
requires a specific handling, e.g., naming the container when starting
it or using multiple shells, which requires very detailed instructions
for users.

You can use the \texttt{-v}/\texttt{-\/-volume} or \texttt{-\/-mount}
flags to \texttt{docker\ run} to configure bind mounts of directories or
files {[}46{]}, including options, as shown in the following examples.
If the target path exists within the image, the bind mount will replace
it for the started container.

How your container expects external resources to be mounted into the
container should be included in the example commands (see
\hyperref[{rule:formatting}]{Rule~\ztitleref{rule:formatting}}). In
these commands, you can also make sure to avoid issues with file
permissions by using Docker's \texttt{-\/-user} option. For example, by
default, writing a new file from inside the container will be owned by
user \texttt{root} on your host, because that is the default user within
the container.

Containers are very well suited for day-to-day development tasks (see
also \hyperref[{rule:usage}]{Rule~\ztitleref{rule:usage}}), because they
support common interactive environments for data science and software
development. But they are also useful for a ``headless'' execution of
full workflows. For example, {[}47{]} demonstrates a container for
running an agent-based model with video files as outputs, and this
article's \href{https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/}{R Markdown} source,
which included cells with analysis code, is
\href{https://github.com/nuest/ten-simple-rules-dockerfiles/blob/master/.travis.yml\#L18}{rendered
into a PDF in a container}. A workflow that does not support headless
execution may even be seen as irreproducible.

These two usages can be configured by the \texttt{Dockerfile}'s author
and exposed to the user based on the \texttt{Dockerfile}'s \texttt{CMD}
and \texttt{ENTRYPOINT} instructions. An image's main purpose is
reflected by the default process and configuration, though the
\texttt{CMD} and \texttt{ENTRYPOINT} can also be changed at runtime. It
is considered good practice to have a combination of default command and
entrypoint that meets reasonable user expectations. For example, a
container known to be a workflow should execute the entrypoint to the
workflow and perhaps use \texttt{-\/-help} as the command to print out
usage. The container entrypoint should \emph{not} execute the workflow,
as the user is likely to run the container for basic inspection, and
starting an analysis as a surprise that might write files is undesired.
As the maintainer of the workflow, you should write clear instructions
for how to properly interact with the container, both for yourself and
others. A possible weakness with using containers is that they can only
provide one default command and entrypoint. However, tools, e.g., The
Scientific Filesystem {[}48{]}, have been developed to expose multiple
entrypoints, environments, help messages, labels, and even install
sequences. With plain Docker, you can override the defaults as part of
the \texttt{docker\ run} command or in an extra \texttt{Dockerfile}
using the primary image as a base, as shown in Listing~5. In any case,
you should document different variants very well and potentially capture
build and run commands in a \texttt{Makefile} {[}27{]}. If you use a
\texttt{Makefile}, then keep it in the same repository (see
\hyperref[{rule:mount}]{Rule~\ztitleref{rule:mount}}) and include
instructions for its usage (see
\hyperref[{rule:document}]{Rule~\ztitleref{rule:document}}). To support
advanced custom configuration, it is helpful to expose settings via a
configuration file, which can be bind mounted from the host {[}47{]},
via environment variables (see
\hyperref[{rule:pinning}]{Rule~\ztitleref{rule:pinning}} and {[}49{]}),
or via wrappers using Docker, such as Kliko {[}50{]}.

\emph{Interactive graphical interfaces}, such as

container to be used across operating systems and both locally and

exposed over HTTP. Use the \texttt{EXPOSE} instruction to document the

A person who is unfamiliar with Docker but wants to use your image may
rely on graphical tools like \href{https://containds.com/}{ContainDS},
\href{https://www.portainer.io/}{Portainer}, or the
\href{https://docs.docker.com/desktop/dashboard/}{Docker Desktop
Dashboard} for assistance in managing containers on their machine
without using the Docker CLI.

\emph{Interactive usage of a command-line interface} is quite
straightforward to access from containers, if users are familiar with
this style of user interface. Running the container will provide a shell
where a tool can be used and where help or error messages can assist the
user. For example, complex workflows in any programming language can,
with suitable pre-configuration, be triggered by running a specific
script file. If your workflow can be executed via a command line client,
you may use that to validate correct functionality of an image in
automated builds, e.g., by using a small toy example and checking the
output, by checking successful responses from HTTP endpoints provided by
the container, such as with an HTTP response code of \texttt{200}, or by
using a controller such as Selenium {[}51{]}.

The following example runs a simple R command counting the lines in this

If there is only a regular desktop application, the host's window
manager can be connected to the container. Although this raises notable
security issues, they can be addressed by using the ``X11 forwarding''
natively supported by Singularity {[}52{]}, which can execute Docker
containers, or by leveraging supporting tools such as \texttt{x11docker}
{[}53{]}. Other alternatives include bridge containers {[}54{]} and
exposing a regular desktop via the browser (e.g., for Jupyter Hub
{[}55{]}). This variety of approaches renders seemingly more convenient
uncontainerised environments unnecessary. Just using one's local machine
is only slightly more comfortable but much less reproducible and
portable.

\ztitlerefsetup{title=9} \zlabel{rule:publish} \label{rule:publish} \zrefused{rule:publish}

Because a \texttt{Dockerfile} is a plain text-based format, it works
well with version control systems. Including a \texttt{Dockerfile}
alongside your code and data is an effective way to consistently build
your software, to show visitors to the repository how it is built and
used, to solicit feedback and collaborate with your peers, and to
increase the impact and sustainability of your work (cf.~{[}56{]}). Most
importantly, you should publish \emph{all} files \texttt{COPY}ied into
the image, e.g., test data or files for software installation from
source (see~\hyperref[{rule:mount}]{Rule~\ztitleref{rule:mount}}), in
the same public repository as the \texttt{Dockerfile}, e.g., in a
research compendium.

Online collaboration platforms (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) also make it easy
to use CI services to test building and executing your image in an
independent environment. Continuous integration increases stability and
trust, and it allows for images to be published automatically.
Automation strategies exist to build and test images for multiple
platforms and software versions, even with CI. Such approaches are often
used when developing popular software packages for a broad user base
operating across a wide range of target platforms and environments, and
they can be leveraged if you expect your workflow to fall into this
category. Furthermore, the commit messages in your version-controlled
repository preserve a record of all changes to the \texttt{Dockerfile},
and you can use the same versions in tags for both the container image
and the git repository.

While there are exceptions to the rule (cf.~{[}57{]}), it is generally
feasible to provide one \texttt{Dockerfile} per project. Alternatively,
you could write multiple \texttt{Dockerfile}s starting \texttt{FROM} one
another, i.e., write your own base images. However, because multiple
files scatter information across multiple places, we recommend avoiding
this at the cost of a longer \texttt{Dockerfile}, which can be mitigated
with formatting
(see~\hyperref[{rule:formatting}]{Rule~\ztitleref{rule:formatting}}).

It is likely going to be the case that over time you will work on
projects and develop images that are similar in nature to each other.
When developing or working on projects with containers, you can switch
between isolated project environments by stopping the container and
restarting it when you are ready to work again, even on another machine
or in a cloud environment. You can even run projects in parallel that do
not share ports without interference. To avoid constantly repeating
yourself, you should consider adopting a standard workflow that will
give you a clean slate for a new project. As an example, cookie cutter
templates {[}58{]} or community templates (e.g., {[}59{]}) can provide
the required structure and files, e.g., for documentation, CI, and
licenses, for getting started. If you decide to build your own cookie
cutter template, consider collaborating with your community during
development of the standard to ensure it will be useful to others.

Part of your project template should be a protocol for publishing the
\texttt{Dockerfile} and even exporting the image to a suitable location,
e.g., a container registry or data repository, taking into consideration
how your workflow can receive a DOI for citation. A template is
preferable to your own set of base images because of the maintenance
efforts the base images require. Therefore, instead of building your own
independent solution, consider contributing to existing suites of images
(see \hyperref[{rule:base}]{Rule~\ztitleref{rule:base}}) and improving
these for your needs.

\ztitlerefsetup{title=10} \zlabel{rule:usage} \label{rule:usage} \zrefused{rule:usage}

Using containers for research workflows requires not only technical
understanding but also an awareness of risks that can be managed
effectively by following a number of good \emph{habits}, discussed in
this section. While there is no firm rule, if you use a container daily,
is good practice to rebuild that container every one or two weeks. At
the time of publication of research results, it is good practice to save
a copy of the image in a public data repository so that readers of the
publication can access the resources that produced the published
results.

First, it is a good habit to use your container every time you work on a
project and not just as a final step during publication. If the
container is the only platform you use, you can be highly confident that
you have properly documented the computing environment {[}60{]}. You
should prioritise this usage over others, e.g., non-interactive
execution of a full workflow, because it gives you personally the
highest value and does not limit your use or others' use of your data
and code at all (see
\hyperref[{rule:interactive}]{Rule~\ztitleref{rule:interactive}}).

Second, for reproducibility, we can treat containers as transient and
disposable, and even intentionally rebuild an image at regular
intervals. Ideally, containers that we built years ago should rebuild
seamlessly, but this is not necessarily the case, especially with
rapidly changing technology relevant to machine learning and data
science. Habitually deleting a container and performing a cache-less
rebuild of the image (a) increases security due to updating underlying
software, (b) helps to reveal issues requiring manual intervention,
e.g., changes to code or configuration that are not documented in the
\texttt{Dockerfile} but perhaps should be, and (c) allows you to more
incrementally debug issues. This habit can be supported by using
continuous deployment or CI strategies.

In you need a setup or configuration for the first two habits, it is
good practice to provide a \texttt{Makefile} alongside your container,
which can capture the specific commands. Furthermore, when you rebuild
the image, you can take a fresh look at the \texttt{Dockerfile} and
improve it over time, because it will be hard to apply all rules at
once. A linter can help you with such optimisations, e.g., as a web
service such as \href{https://www.dockerfilelint.com/}{Dockerfilelint},
\href{https://hadolint.github.io/hadolint/}{hadolint} or
\href{https://www.fromlatest.io/}{fromlatest}, as an extension to your
integrated development environment, such as
\href{https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker}{vscode-docker}, or as
standalone tools like
\href{https://github.com/projectatomic/dockerfile_lint}{\texttt{dockerfile-lint}},
which you can integrate with your \texttt{Makefile}.

Third, from time to time you can reduce the system resources occupied by
Docker images and their layers or unused containers, volumes and
networks by running \texttt{docker\ system\ prune\ -\/-all}. After a
prune is performed, it follows naturally to rebuild a container for
local usage or to pull it again from a newly built registry image. This
habit can be automated with a cron job {[}61{]}.

Fourth, you can export the image to file and deposit it in a public data
repository, where it not only becomes citable but also provides a
snapshot of the \emph{actual} environment you used at a specific point
in time. You should include instructions for how to import and run the
workflow based on the image archive and add your own image tags using
semantic versioning (see
\hyperref[{rule:base}]{Rule~\ztitleref{rule:base}}) for clarity.
Depositing the image next to other project files, i.e., data, code, and
the used \texttt{Dockerfile}, in a public repository makes them likely
to be preserved, but it is highly unlikely that over time you will be
able to recreate it precisely from the accompanying \texttt{Dockerfile}.
Publishing the image and the contained metadata therein (e.g., the
Docker version used) may even allow future science historians to emulate
the Docker environment. Sharing the actual image via a registry and a
version-controlled \texttt{Dockerfile} together allows you to freely
experiment and continue developing your workflow and keep the image up
to date, e.g., updating versions of pinned dependencies (see
\hyperref[{rule:pinning}]{Rule~\ztitleref{rule:pinning}}) and regular
image building (see above).

Finally, for a sanity check and to foster even higher trust in the
stability and documentation of your project, you can ask a colleague or
community member to be your code copilot (see
\url{https://twitter.com/Code_Copilot}) to interact with your workflow
container on a machine of their own. You can do this shortly before
submitting your reproducible workflow for peer-review, so you are well
positioned for the future of scholarly communication and open science,
where these may be standard practices required for publication
{[}21,62--64{]}.

\hypertarget{example-dockerfiles}{%

To demonstrate the ten rules, we maintain a collection of annotated
example \texttt{Dockerfile}s in a GitHub repository, some of which we

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\section*{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Conclusion}

In this article we have provided guidance for using \texttt{Dockerfile}s
to create containers for use and communication in smaller-scale data
science research. Reproducibility in research is an endeavor of
incremental improvement and best efforts, not about achieving the
perfect solution; such a solution may be not achievable for many
researchers with limited resources, and its definition may change over
time. Even if imperfect, the effort to create and document scientific
workflows provides incredibly useful and valuable transparency for a
project. We encourage researchers to follow these steps taken by their
peers to use \texttt{Dockerfile}s to practice reproducible research, and
we encourage them to promote change in the way scholars communicate
towards an open and friendly ``preproducibility'' {[}65{]}. So, we ask
researchers, with their best efforts and with their current knowledge,
to strive to write readable \texttt{Dockerfile}s for functional
containers that are realistic about what might break and what is
unlikely to break. In a similar vein, we accept that researchers will
freely break these rules if another approach makes more sense \emph{for
their use case}. Also, we ask that researchers not overwhelm themselves
by trying to follow all the rules right away, but that they set up an
iterative process to increase their computing environment's
manageability over time. Most importantly, we ask researchers to share
and exchange their \texttt{Dockerfile}s freely and to collaborate in
their communities to spread the knowledge about containers as a tool for
research and scholarly collaboration and communication.
