Summary
=======

1. Use available tools
    a. Image registries (e.g. Docker Hub),
    b. Dockerfile generators (e.g. repo2docker)
    c. Project templates (e.g. [cookie cutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter))
    d. Linters
2. Use versioned images
    a. Mention specific sha digests?
3. Format for clarity
    a. Use indentation, line breaks and unabbreviated arguments
    b. Clarity > brevity
    c. Group related commands
4. Document within the Dockerfile
    a. Add comments explaining the steps
    b. Use labels for metadata
    c. Include build and run commands
6. Specify software versions
    a. Pin system library versions
    b. Explictly list package versions to install
    c. Comment why each is needed
9. Use version control
    a. Use Continuous Integration and automated testing
    b. ~~Use one Dockerfile per project~~
    c. ~~Use project templates (e.g. cookie cutter)~~
7. Mount user data
    a. Use bind mount for accessibility
    b. Keep large or sensitive datasets out with `.dockerignore`
    c. Document expected mounts for external resources
5. Order the instructions
    a. Least --> most changable for caching and fast builds
    b. Regularly use `--no-cache` to catch problems
8. Make it one-click runnable
    a. Set default behaviour with `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT`
10. Regularly use and rebuild containers
    a. Use the container throughout each project for confidence in your workflow
    b. Rebuild every 1-2 weeks with `--no-cache` to catch problems

    d. Ask a colleague to try it
    e. Push the image to a public registry at publication time
