Summary
=======

1. Use available tools
    a. Use ready-made images (e.g. from Docker Hub)
    b. Dockerfile generators (e.g. repo2docker)
    c. Project templates (e.g. [cookie cutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter)) [new]
    d. Linters
2. Use versioned images
    a. Use version-tagged base images
    b. Publish your own images with version tags [revise]
3. Format for clarity
    a. Use indentation, line breaks and unabbreviated arguments
    b. Clarity is better than brevity
    c. Group related commands
4. Document within the Dockerfile
    a. Add comments explaining the instructions
    b. Use labels for metadata
    c. Include usage instructions
6. Specify software versions
    a. Pin system library versions
    b. Explictly list package versions to install
    c. Comment why each is needed
9. Use version control
    a. Use Continuous Integration and automated testing
    b. ~~Use one Dockerfile per project~~ [revise]
    c. ~~Use project templates (e.g. cookie cutter)~~ [remove]
7. Mount user data
    a. Use bind mounts for accessibility
    b. Keep large or sensitive datasets out with `.dockerignore`
    c. Document expected mounts for external resources
5. Order the instructions
    a. Least --> most changable for caching and fast builds
    b. Regularly use `--no-cache` to catch problems [duplicate: 10b]
8. Make it one-click runnable
    a. Set default behaviour with `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT`
    b. Document how to use it interactively
10. Regularly use and rebuild containers
    a. Use the container throughout each project for confidence in your workflow
    b. Rebuild every 1-2 weeks with `--no-cache` to catch problems
    c. Provide a `Makefile` or script for convenience
    d. Ask a colleague to try it
    e. Push the image to a public registry at publication time
